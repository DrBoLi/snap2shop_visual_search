## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set up environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="your_production_database_url"
export NODE_ENV="production"

# Optional: External analytics integration
export SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY="your_segment_key"
```

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# Run production migration
npm run setup

# Verify migration
npx prisma migrate status
```

### 3. Analytics System Verification
```bash
# Run complete analytics setup
npm run analytics:setup

# Test analytics functionality
npm run analytics:test

# Populate sample data (optional)
npm run analytics:populate
```

### 4. Application Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting platform
npm run deploy
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Dashboard Access
- [ ] Navigate to `/app/dashboard` in your Shopify app
- [ ] Verify analytics data is loading
- [ ] Test timeframe selection (7 days, 1 month, 3 months)
- [ ] Check that metrics display correctly

#### Widget Testing
- [ ] Install visual search widget on a test store
- [ ] Perform test searches
- [ ] Verify click tracking is working
- [ ] Check analytics data appears in dashboard

#### API Endpoints
- [ ] Test `/apps/proxy/analytics/track` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/apps/proxy/analytics/search` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/apps/proxy/analytics/click` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/api/analytics-dashboard` endpoint

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Monitoring
- [ ] Check analytics data collection
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Verify error rates are low
- [ ] Check database performance

### Weekly Maintenance
```bash
# Run data cleanup
npm run analytics:cleanup

# Check system health
npm run analytics:setup
```

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review analytics performance
- [ ] Analyze user behavior patterns
- [ ] Update retention policies if needed
- [ ] Check for data anomalies

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Add additional indexes if needed
- [ ] Consider partitioning for large datasets
- [ ] Implement archiving strategy

### Caching Strategy
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for dashboard data
- [ ] Cache popular content queries
- [ ] Use CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement edge caching

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Monitor concurrent user limits
- [ ] Plan for database scaling
- [ ] Consider read replicas for analytics
- [ ] Implement queue system for heavy processing

## Security & Compliance

### Data Privacy
- [ ] Verify GDPR compliance
- [ ] Test data anonymization
- [ ] Check data retention policies
- [ ] Validate user data export/deletion

### Security Measures
- [ ] Rate limiting is active
- [ ] Input validation is working
- [ ] SQL injection protection
- [ ] XSS protection implemented

### Access Control
- [ ] Shop-scoped data access only
- [ ] Admin authentication required
- [ ] API endpoint protection
- [ ] Sensitive data encryption

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Analytics Not Tracking
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check CORS configuration
4. Validate shop domain detection

#### Dashboard Showing Zeros
1. Verify data aggregation is running
2. Check database connection
3. Run analytics setup script
4. Verify sample data exists

#### Performance Issues
1. Check database query performance
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Verify indexing is working
4. Consider pre-aggregation

#### Rate Limiting Errors
1. Check rate limit configuration
2. Monitor request patterns
3. Adjust limits if needed
4. Implement exponential backoff

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check analytics system health
npm run analytics:setup

# Test with sample data
npm run analytics:test

# Clean up old data
npm run analytics:cleanup

# View database status
npx prisma studio
```
